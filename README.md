# PWA(Programmers With Attitude) - Live Online PvP Game

## Description

#### An App which allows users to play a selection of classic games within their browser (TicTacToe, Hangman, Battleship and Chess) against computer players to entertain themselves, develop their skills and eventually display a leaderboard with their Win/Loss ratio! Long-term development, the plan is to add a live chat application and multiplayer game options both using GraphQL Subscriptions; we also hope to add a difficulty scale for the games rather than having all the Computer players as randomized bots. 

#### Due to difficulties we had to start over with a new repository, this is part of an attempt at refactoring the original starting repository: https://github.com/apostlex11/PWA-PROJECT
